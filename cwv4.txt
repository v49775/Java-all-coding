The collections framework is a unified architecture for representing and
manipulating collections, enabling them to be manipulated independently of
 the details of their representation. It reduces programming effort while increasin
  performance. It enables interoperability among unrelated APIs, reduces effort in designing
   and learning new APIs, and fosters software reuse. The framework is based on more than a dozen
    collection interfaces. It includes implementations of these interfaces
     and algorithms to manipulate them.
